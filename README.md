# Cat vs. Dog Classification with Deep Neural Networks

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that explores the development and comparison of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for image classification, specifically focusing on distinguishing between cats and dogs. Two models are constructed and evaluated:

## Contents

1. **Architecture Comparison**: Explores the design and rationale behind each network.
2. **Implementation Details**: Provides code snippets for building and training the models.
3. **Results and Analysis**: Compares the performance of both DNNs.


- **2-Layer Neural Network**: A simple architecture with one hidden layer for initial comprehension.
- **L-Layer Neural Network**: A more intricate architecture with multiple hidden layers to harness deeper learning capabilities.

## Key Learnings

- The L-Layer DNN achieved 80% accuracy, surpassing the 2-Layer network's 72% accuracy.
- The notebook elucidates the architectures, comprising LINEAR -> RELU -> LINEAR -> SIGMOID structures.
- A learning rate of 0.0075 was utilized for both models.


## Further Exploration

- Experiment with different network architectures and hyperparameters.
- Explore deeper learning techniques like convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
- Apply the model to other image classification tasks.
